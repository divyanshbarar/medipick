# Subject: Medical Asset Dashboard Assignment Completion

Project Overview
I've developed a comprehensive medical asset tracking dashboard that provides real-time monitoring of hospital equipment and services. The dashboard includes:

Asset tracking with status indicators (working, not working, discarded)
Service and maintenance monitoring
Calibration status visualization
Incident tracking and reporting
Warranty status tracking
Client performance metrics
"Need Attention" section for critical assets requiring immediate action
Technologies Implemented
React.js: Created modular, reusable components for better maintainability
React Router: Implemented routing for a single-page application experience
Recharts.js: Utilized for responsive, interactive data visualization (bar charts and pie charts)
Tailwind CSS: Applied for responsive design and consistent styling
Component Architecture: Broke down the UI into reusable components for better code organization and maintainability
Development Process
I completed this project under a tight timeline, focusing first on core functionality and data visualization. The dashboard effectively displays critical information about medical assets, their statuses, and maintenance requirements in an intuitive interface.

Future Enhancements
Given additional time, I plan to:

Refine typography with improved font selection
Replace placeholder images with appropriate icons
Enhance the overall design with more refined visual elements
Add additional interactive features for filtering and sorting data
Optimize the dashboard for different screen sizes
Add animation for a more engaging user experience
I welcome any feedback on the current implementation and would be happy to discuss any aspects of the project in more detail.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment.

Best regards, Divyansh Barar
